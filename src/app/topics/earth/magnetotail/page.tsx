          Magnetic reconnection is a physical process occurring in electrically
          conducting plasmas, in which the magnetic topology is rearranged and
          magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy, thermal energy, and
          particle acceleration.[4] Magnetic reconnection involves plasma flows at
          a substantial fraction of the Alfvén wave speed, which is the
          fundamental speed for mechanical information flow in a magnetized
          plasma.
