        The Van Allen radiation belts are two concentric zones of highly charged
        particles that encircle the Earth within its magnetosphere. These belts,
        first discovered by the American scientist James Van Allen in 1958, are
        pivotal features in understanding our planet&apos;s interaction with the
        space environment.

        The inner radiation belt, situated closer to Earth, primarily comprises
        energetic protons and electrons. These particles are the result of
        interactions between cosmic rays and Earth&apos;s upper atmosphere. The
        outer radiation belt, located farther out, is primarily composed of
        high-energy electrons of solar origin, accelerated by geomagnetic
        processes.
